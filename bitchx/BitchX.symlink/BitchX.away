[SEND_MSG] [10:19am] - #kakoune So, EDN files are basically clojure, without
           the keywords.  Should I make clojure.kak detect edn as clojure, and
           add a conditional to not add the keywords?  Or make a different
           filetype?
[SEND_MSG] [10:52am] - #kakoune alex``: It's a regular file that gets symlinked
           to ~/.bash_profile

[SEND_MSG] [06:07pm] - #kakoune So I had to transform some JSON into EDN,
           picking out a few fields.  A thing I've done with Vim quite a few
           times.  And with Kakoune, it was really a breeze.
[SEND_MSG] [06:08pm] - #kakoune Made me happy. :D  <a-k> is super useful

[SEND_MSG] [10:37am] - #kakoune on my kakoune todo list this week: figure out
           how to make a hook for when the user runs "cat foo |kak" and run
           ansi-render, figure out how to track state to update an ANSI buffer
           when fifo data is received (if this even makes sense), run parinfer
           automatically on clojure buffers, and see if I can't solve "waiting
           for shell command to finish" with <a-|>.  That's alot.

[SEND_MSG] [01:22pm] - #kakoune what's the idiomatic way to name it?  kak-ansi?
           ansi.kak?

           to kak, the buffer is created but empty?
[SEND_MSG] [01:59pm] - #kakoune And there's no other hooks called until

[SEND_MSG] [11:06am] - #kakoune It would be cool to track frequency of normal
           mode commands while coding.
[SEND_MSG] [11:07am] - #kakoune ironzorg: awesome
[SEND_MSG] [11:07am] - #kakoune I care about my own by itself.  But also,
           comparing two users, especially mawww, might make one of them go,
           "hey, wait a minute..."
[SEND_MSG] [11:08am] - #kakoune I'm going to bet that I'm like h/j/k/l then
           ^U/^D then m then c/<a-X>/<gt>/<lt>
[SEND_MSG] [11:09am] - #kakoune I used those all the time in Vim, but not in
           Kakoune.  Not sure why.
[SEND_MSG] [11:09am] - #kakoune In any case, it's not about right/wrong, but
           learning shorter ways to do things.
[SEND_MSG] [11:38am] - #kakoune Hmm, so parinfer is going to be a mess without
           something like Vim's undojoin.  Hrmm.
[SEND_MSG] [11:39am] - #kakoune That's a big project, methinks.  But also
           involves philosophy, perhaps.
[SEND_MSG] [11:40am] - #kakoune Doesn't that make a single insert require two
           undos?  I need to merge it with the user's edit.
[SEND_MSG] [11:40am] - #kakoune yeah, it does
[SEND_MSG] [11:41am] - #kakoune Oh, in kakoune, it might be an option to
           exec/eval.
[SEND_MSG] [11:41am] - #kakoune how so?
[SEND_MSG] [11:43am] - #kakoune Ah...  Right...
[SEND_MSG] [11:44am] - #kakoune I could undo *first*, then replay with the
           changes in my case.
[SEND_MSG] [11:45am] - #kakoune Ugh, so, since I want to do it in one go, I'd
           have to make all my changes with coordinates computed from the
           undone buffer, which is painful.
[SEND_MSG] [11:53am] - #kakoune Well, I think it's useful to discuss, even if
           there's a different approach mawww likes.
[SEND_MSG] [11:59am] - #kakoune Ahhh, I'm not necessarily seeing lack of
           undojoin really.  It's that parinfer makes a bunch of small edits,
           so when I undo, there's multiple cursors.

[SEND_MSG] [12:00pm] - #kakoune Because of #1184
           https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/1184
[SEND_MSG] [12:00pm] - #kakoune It would be much better to fix this.
[SEND_MSG] [12:04pm] - #kakoune Or... I'm wrong.  No, I'm wrong.
[SEND_MSG] [12:29pm] - #kakoune Franciman: That doesn't really help.  I'd need
           to save selections prior to the user's arbitrary change, I think.
[SEND_MSG] [12:32pm] - #kakoune I wonder if there's an interesting way to pack
           a selection into a 64-bit integer.

[SEND_MSG] [09:52am] - #kakoune parinfer responds with an updated cursor

[TimeStamp Thu Oct 25 10:00:00 2018]
[SEND_MSG] [10:42am] - #kakoune wat?  Don't selections and selections_desc have
           to line up?  I was relying on that in earlier versions of ansi.kak
[SEND_MSG] [10:44am] - #kakoune They don't.  I guess I made them always line
           up.

[SEND_MSG] [11:48am] - #kakoune parinfer is alive!!
[SEND_MSG] [11:49am] - #kakoune I mean, it needs a bit of polish, but it is
           live.
[SEND_MSG] [11:49am] - #kakoune I've only tested clojure.
[SEND_MSG] [11:49am] - #kakoune In theory, also Scheme and CL
[SEND_MSG] [11:50am] - #kakoune Oh, I didn't solve the cursor position thing
           yet, tho... FYI.  If you type an opening bracket, the cursor jumps.
[SEND_MSG] [11:50am] - #kakoune But inserting text before an opening paren
           pushes the whole structure, and reindenting fixes parens and all
           that.
[SEND_MSG] [11:50am] - #kakoune So warning... it is rough.  But barely usable,
           finally.

[SEND_MSG] [10:32am] - #kakoune so, uh, I just had a thought.  Kakoune doesn't
           support 3i0<esc> like vim does.  Kind of makes sense, it's a bit of
           a can of worms.  But, what if 3i made 3 (or 3x) the cursors?
[SEND_MSG] [10:33am] - #kakoune The hard bit is that it would start with three
           cursors in the same location.
[SEND_MSG] [10:33am] - #kakoune Which I think Kakoune doesn't support.
[SEND_MSG] [10:34am] - #kakoune yeah, hey I didn't know it did that.
[SEND_MSG] [10:35am] - #kakoune hmm, feels very kakoune-y.
[SEND_MSG] [10:35am] - #kakoune this goes back to my theory that "cursors (and
           therefore anchors also) are really zero-width things"

           since the splits are more general.
[SEND_MSG] [11:47am] - #kakoune Looks like i3 is the right answer, then.  (I'm
           on OSX.  And I live in tmux anyway.)
[SEND_MSG] [11:58am] - #kakoune JosephFerano: I have surprisingly uninteresting
           needs in this department.  I have a curved ultra-wide monitor that

           browser, and that's all I really use.

[SEND_MSG] [12:01pm] - #kakoune I've been using tmux in a full screen terminal
           since well before Kakoune.  Not actually sure when I started.
[SEND_MSG] [12:03pm] - #kakoune I think I hang onto qwerty as sort of a thread
           of sanity.
[SEND_MSG] [12:04pm] - #kakoune me, too.  I just seem to have too many running
           that haven't hit the inflection point yet.
[SEND_MSG] [12:05pm] - #kakoune I guess I'm actually past the inflection point
           for keyboard.  That was pretty rough.
[SEND_MSG] [12:06pm] - #kakoune JosephFerano: agreed.  I've worked around, I
           think, three software/OS bugs with my keyboard :D
[SEND_MSG] [12:06pm] - #kakoune JosephFerano: That's what I've got :D

[SEND_MSG] [03:39pm] - #kakoune I have tmux configured so that <c-w>N goes to
           pane N, but I'm wondering if I should map it so that <c-w>X goes to
           the pane at X, where X is a letter from my right hand that's mapped
           to a grid based on position.
[SEND_MSG] [03:39pm] - #kakoune e.g, <c-w>y goes to the upper left corner,
           <c-w>/ goes to the lower-right.
[SEND_MSG] [03:41pm] - #kakoune Mmm, probably better to do it left-handed and
           with control...  <c-w><c-q> goes to upper left?
[SEND_MSG] [03:42pm] - #kakoune Orr I should just practice typing numbers so
           that I can actually go to panes 5 and 6 :D
[TimeStamp Mon Oct 29 16:00:00 2018]
[SEND_MSG] [04:11pm] - #kakoune The right-hand column is somewhat standard
           (todo list, [tool-window,] shell, repl), the rest are different
           files and the only pattern there is that I usually open the test
           file just to the right of the implementation file.
[SEND_MSG] [04:12pm] - #kakoune I'm thinking, if I'm fairly accurate at
           guessing which key corresponds to a window, then it saves me trying
           to look at the gutter to find the pane number.  Which is awkward,
           even though I've made it bright.

           when used iwth the file type macros...  File mode bits and the
           contents of the remaining members of the stat structure are

[SEND_MSG] [03:03pm] - #kakoune So, S_ISREG() shoudl work, but the executable

[SEND_MSG] [03:06pm] - #kakoune man 2 stat() says "BSD System Calls Manual" as

[SEND_MSG] [03:12pm] - #kakoune Ahh, OK.  So the permissions are actually
           correct, even though I'm not sure they should be.  The problem is
           that confstr(_CS_PATH,...) doesn't return $PATH, but "a value for

[SEND_MSG] [03:15pm] - #kakoune Ha, and the dumb-ass Mac OS X "you can't change

[SEND_MSG] [03:29pm] - #kakoune I mean, are you trying to get the cwd of the

[SEND_MSG] [03:32pm] - #kakoune My memory is kind of vague, but I think the
           terminal emulator ends up being the ... head ... of a process group,

[SEND_MSG] [09:55am] - #kakoune It seems that "xterm-keys" enables this

[TimeStamp Sun Nov 11 14:00:00 2018]
[SEND_MSG] [02:14pm] - #kakoune Hmm, I've not done user modes much.
[SEND_MSG] [02:16pm] - #kakoune I take it that "map global mymode c {: exec
           'c'}" doesn't do it?
[SEND_MSG] [02:17pm] - #kakoune I mean, the docs seem to imply that "map global
           mymode c c" might do it.
[SEND_MSG] [02:18pm] - #kakoune er, there's supposed to be a % before the first
           curly.
[SEND_MSG] [02:18pm] - #kakoune Doesn't it say user modes only apply to the
           next key?
[SEND_MSG] [02:19pm] - #kakoune I don't even know what that is... is it an
           extension?
[SEND_MSG] [02:19pm] - #kakoune oooh
[SEND_MSG] [02:19pm] - #kakoune right, so you probably want to "map global
           mymode c <esc>c"
[SEND_MSG] [02:19pm] - #kakoune Oh, but, that's in normal mode.
[SEND_MSG] [02:20pm] - #kakoune So maybe <esc><esc>c , since the modes are a
           stack?

[SEND_MSG] [10:39am] - #kakoune Is `*` with just the cursor selected supposed
           to expand the selection to a word?  I don't understand the docs, I
           think.
[SEND_MSG] [10:39am] - #kakoune Or just shrink it?
[SEND_MSG] [10:48am] - #kakoune ahh
[SEND_MSG] [10:49am] - #kakoune so it's really "/y then.
[SEND_MSG] [10:53am] - #kakoune well, right.  I mean, coming from Vim, I
           expected * to search.  Then I realized it just set "/ but it kept
           being broken (not taking the whole word), now I realize it's really
           *just* setting "/ (perhaps adding \b)
[SEND_MSG] [10:56am] - #kakoune it does seem that, since * has special handling
           for word boundaries, I should really just map it to <a-i>w"/y . I
           don't think I every want a word boundary on one side.

[SEND_MSG] [11:07am] - #kakoune I've been reading about (and working with)
           production systems, Rete, and datalog a whole bunch, and it seems
           like it could be a general replacement for a bunch of things in
           Kakoune - options, highlighters, ... ?
[SEND_MSG] [11:08am] - #kakoune JosephFerano: Interesting approach.
[SEND_MSG] [11:10am] - #kakoune I suspect the datalog thing is too difficult to
           explain, though.

[SEND_MSG] [11:43am] - #kakoune huh, interesting.  You could do: kak $(git diff
           --check | cut -d: -f1 |sort -u)
[SEND_MSG] [11:43am] - #kakoune but there's no switches or anything to disable
           that
[SEND_MSG] [11:44am] - #kakoune I wonder if it could detect stdin better.
[SEND_MSG] [11:45am] - #kakoune I suspect that kakoune actually gets /dev/null
           for stdin in this case, and it probably just checks for isatty().
[SEND_MSG] [11:45am] - #kakoune I think *that* scratch buffer is from not
           having a buffer on the command line
[SEND_MSG] [11:49am] - #kakoune Yeah, so the `|xargs kak` thing is definitely
           because stdin is either a tty, or gets read into *stdin*.
[SEND_MSG] [11:50am] - #kakoune ^^ sounds good
[SEND_MSG] [11:50am] - #kakoune I'm not sure what to do, except possibly
           killing *stdin* if it's zero bytes.  I doubt the process knows its
           input is /dev/null.

[SEND_MSG] [12:01pm] - #kakoune OK, it's definitely something not being
           measured with `set global debug profile`; my keyboard repeat rate is
           set to 30ms, and holding j down for 27 lines moves through 5 or so
           lines, then jumps to the bottom after a pause.
[SEND_MSG] [12:37pm] - #kakoune it doesn't happen in Vim (though I found out
           that 30ms is slower than I thought), it happens only a little with
           kak -n.

[SEND_MSG] [12:11am] - #kakoune dpc: yup
[SEND_MSG] [12:11am] - #kakoune Pretty nice one, IMHO.
[SEND_MSG] [12:12am] - #kakoune So, I really really want an expansion with the
           buffer's contents.  Is this a thing that has been discussed before?
[SEND_MSG] [12:13am] - #kakoune No, I mean a %val{buffer_contents} and
           $kak_buffer_contents, for example.
[SEND_MSG] [12:14am] - #kakoune Which I can get from $kak_selection after '%',
           but I need to pass both the contents and selection info to
           parinfer-rust.
[SEND_MSG] [12:18am] - #kakoune :)  ... well, right, this happens on every
           keystroke tho.
[SEND_MSG] [12:18am] - #kakoune Two version of the entire buffer, in fact.
[SEND_MSG] [12:19am] - #kakoune shachaf: I kind of don't want to clobber any

[SEND_MSG] [12:19am] - #kakoune dbc: because in Kakoune, having no selection is
           an error.
[SEND_MSG] [12:19am] - #kakoune yes
[SEND_MSG] [12:20am] - #kakoune Does it do something in a catch?
[SEND_MSG] [12:23am] - #kakoune Hmm, is it because you are in insert mode when
           the completion menu is up, so without that, you couldn't insert
           whitespace?
[SEND_MSG] [12:24am] - #kakoune oh, still backward, huh? I dunno.

           https://asciinema.org/a/iMxZ19c4caRQ3rdc17yzYnfYd
[SEND_MSG] [11:11pm] - #kakoune Going to record and upload about three more, I
           think.
[SEND_MSG] [11:14pm] - #kakoune Indenting and dedenting with < and > with
           parinfer in Clojure (so it automatically fixes braces).
[SEND_MSG] [11:14pm] - #kakoune It does everything you see here:
           http://shaunlebron.github.io/parinfer/ ... I'm just recording doing
           it in Kakoune.
[SEND_MSG] [11:21pm] - #kakoune dpc: Until today, it had bad performance issues
           and and parinfer_enabled was off by default.  You should update!
[SEND_MSG] [11:21pm] - #kakoune Screw
[SEND_MSG] [11:21pm] - #kakoune Screwtape: it's a port to rust of a thing for
           Lisp.
[SEND_MSG] [11:22pm] - #kakoune It was originally written in JavaScript, and
           that was not usable realtime from Vim.
[SEND_MSG] [11:23pm] - #kakoune it was written in pure JavaScript, with a
           little nodejs thunk and it was used that way in a bunch of editors.
[SEND_MSG] [11:24pm] - #kakoune it was designed for Lisp, since Lisp has a
           property where indentation and parentheses must match.
[SEND_MSG] [11:25pm] - #kakoune It has sort of the opposite approach to
           paredit, which doesn't allow you to edit parentheses because you
           have to work with lisp structural objects.
[SEND_MSG] [11:26pm] - #kakoune Parinfer is neat because most of the things
           paredit does just emerge, like slurp and barf.
[SEND_MSG] [11:28pm] - #kakoune well, the trick here is that the structure is
           always encoded twice hence "infer".  I don't think that's true for
           Python.  I mean,  you know the line after a : is indented, but you
           don't know the line after that.
[SEND_MSG] [11:31pm] - #kakoune Yea, sorry :D
[SEND_MSG] [11:31pm] - #kakoune If I could stop hacking on Kakoune plugins,
           it's what I write 40 hours a week.
[SEND_MSG] [11:32pm] - #kakoune Yeah, the name is unfortunate, I guess.  I'm
           bad at naming things.
[SEND_MSG] [11:35pm] - #kakoune
           https://asciinema.org/a/6U5weRwpisGFsqNwoL4bFLpyB <-- this is the
           cool one, I think
[SEND_MSG] [11:37pm] - #kakoune eh, the problem is that that ship has sunk...
           78 stars and a lot of Vim users.
[SEND_MSG] [11:40pm] - #kakoune You can, I think it will break people who have
           it cloned in their bundle directory.  Maybe I'm wrong?
[SEND_MSG] [11:40pm] - #kakoune I know it redirects your web when you rename.
[SEND_MSG] [11:41pm] - #kakoune OK. I'm updating the README now.
[SEND_MSG] [11:43pm] - #kakoune First line after title: "Infer parentheses for
           Clojure, Lisp, and Scheme".
[SEND_MSG] [11:43pm] - #kakoune Ahhh.  Right.  And that's not really the
           interesting bit to users.
[SEND_MSG] [11:44pm] - #kakoune Rust, I mean.
[SEND_MSG] [11:45pm] - #kakoune
           https://asciinema.org/a/QrZ06KsfxOBNMD8DUt7u6bbgD <-- maybe this is
           the cool one?
[SEND_MSG] [11:47pm] - #kakoune (The error is something with the Kakoune
           wrapper code.  I left it in for honesty's sake.)

[SEND_MSG] [11:34am] - #kakoune it would be nice to set ncurses_set_title=false
           and set the window title to *just* the filename.  AFAICT, there's no
           way to get raw access to the terminal during shell expansion. 
           There's not a $kak_client_TTY or anything.  Ideas?

[SEND_MSG] [09:57am] - #kakoune This year it felt a bit more Cognitect-y to me.
            They announced a bunch of things.  I skipped a bunch of AI talks
           which I plan to watch on youtube, so maybe I'm just making that up.
[SEND_MSG] [09:58am] - #kakoune I'm there.  I mean, it's probably not in the
           states right?
[SEND_MSG] [09:58am] - #kakoune So I shouldn't promise that yet.

[SEND_MSG] [10:16am] - #kakoune rschulman: is that literally blockchain
           messaging?
[SEND_MSG] [10:17am] - #kakoune heh, well I didn't get to the history
           resolution part yet :D
[SEND_MSG] [10:18am] - #kakoune wait, does it have a curses-based client?
[SEND_MSG] [10:18am] - #kakoune cause that would solve like six problems for
           me, if it does.
[SEND_MSG] [10:21am] - #kakoune (and it does!)
[SEND_MSG] [10:24am] - #kakoune Hmm, now I'll have to see if I can connect it
           to my work Slack, which has 2FA.
